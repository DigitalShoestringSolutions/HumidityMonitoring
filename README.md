# Starter Solution Template
Creating a repository from this template will start it with the file structure shown here.
This will mean that a standard set of actions can be applied and some typical files, however sadly none of the branches or repository settings will be transferred.

This README will detail the steps that should be taken after using this template to get a starter solution into our standard format.

# Checklist
